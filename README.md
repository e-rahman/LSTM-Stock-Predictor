# LSTM-Stock-Predictor

Which model has a lower loss?
-	The Closing Price model consistently demonstrated a lower loss rate over each epoch.
Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
-	The Closing Price model consistently outperformed the Fear and Greed model at predicting actual values over time.
Which window size works best for the model?
-	A window size of 10 worked just slightly better than a window size of 9.  The FNG model didn't show too much variance between a window size of 9 and 10, but there was a more noticeable difference with the Closing Price model.
